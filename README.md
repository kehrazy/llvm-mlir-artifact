# LLVM/MLIR/Clang Build Artifacts Package 🛠️📦

[![Build Status](https://img.shields.io/github/actions/workflow/status/kehrazy/llvm-mlir-artifact/build_llvm.yml?style=flat-square)](https://github.com/yourusername/llvm-artifacts/actions)

A minimalist pipeline to build and package **production-ready LLVM/MLIR/Clang binaries** for developers who need precompiled toolchains without the build hassle.

The main idea is to use this as a template - just fork this project, modify the configuration and have your own LLVM build ready. Do whatever, I don't care.
